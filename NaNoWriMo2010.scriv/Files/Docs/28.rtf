\f0\fs26 \cf0 If you adhere to the strictest NaNoWriMo guidelines, anything you write that is not part of the novel itself doesn't count as words towards your 50,000 word target. Consequently the session goal counter has been set to 
\i ignore
\i0  anything you write outside of the Manuscript folder above. If you forget, close Scrivener in the middle of your session (thus resetting the counter), or otherwise lose track of how many words you wrote, you can always use the Project > Project Statistics panel to get a total count of everything in the Manuscript folder.\
\
If you wish to have external material counted toward your daily goal, you can adjust this in the Project Targets panel, by clicking the Options button. You can also turn on Growl notifications here, so that pop-up notifications appear on screen to alert you when you have met your targets.}
